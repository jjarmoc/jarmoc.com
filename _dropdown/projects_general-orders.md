I'm working on collecting the General Orders for all Chicago Area Police Departments. This involves filing quite a few FOIA requests, and collating the resulting responses. You can [view the results](https://jjarmoc.github.io/chicago-area-general-orders/), or [help me out](https://github.com/jjarmoc/chicago-area-general-orders).
