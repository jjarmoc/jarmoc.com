I decided to try to try and get back on the blogging bandwagon.  This will be where that happens.

I found my previous attempts encumbered by heavier blogging platforms that required a little more effort to work with.  This left me putting off various posts until eventually they just didn't happen at all.  For this attempt, I'm trying [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).  So far, I'm happy with it.

Octopress has a number of features that I like over other platforms I've tried in the past:

-	Static content generation (Less attack surface)
-	Markdown formatting for posts
-	Rake integration for creating posts, pages, etc..
-	[Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) support
-	Git workflow for pushing updates, etc.

In short, it's lighter weight and fits better with tools I already use frequently.  This should make it less burdensome and thus lead to more posts from me.  Or at least, that's the plan.
