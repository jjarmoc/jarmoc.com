Your security infrastructure (firewalls, IDS/IPS devices, management consoles, etc.) holds a very sensitive position of trust. This equipment is relied upon to reliably perform security critical functions under potentially hostile conditions. These are highly valuable assets to an attacker, yet their value is sometimes not captured by conventional risk management. This presentation will explore several new vulnerabilities and weaknesses in these products, with the goal of offering useful recommendations and approaches for mitigating the risk.

This presentation explores a series of vulnerabilities and weaknesses in security infrastructure that we discovered and responsibly disclosed. Weâ€™re in the business of managing and monitoring this gear for our clients, so we have great familiarity with all aspects of its operation. We've found that security infrastructure appears to be just as prone to security vulnerabilities as other commercial software, if not more so.
